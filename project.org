  CLOSED: [2020-09-29 Tue 00:18]
** DONE Loading and synchronizing local cache of issues
   CLOSED: [2020-09-29 Tue 00:13]
** DONE Interface for incrementally searching the issues.


* [2/6] v1: Make it usable - functionality showcase.
** DONE Cleanup the PoC of incremental search
   CLOSED: [2020-09-29 Tue 16:14]
   Published, more/less cleanuped.
** DONE Issue view with some details.
   CLOSED: [2020-09-30 Wed 02:55]
   - Summary, description
   - Assignee, reporter
   - Status
   - Generate with configurable jinja? (maybe later?)
** TODO Adding worklogs from issue view
** TODO Add some dashboard information
   - Database stats:
     - Date of the last sync.
     - Number of issues
   - Current user stats? (Jinja2?)
     - Like number of assigned issues split by status.
     - Worklogs stats.
** TODO Show status and issue type in a search list.
   Different themes based on... status? Or Issue type.
** TODO Synchronizing worklogs along the rest of data.

* [0/8] v2: Close and simple needs.
** TODO Creating similar issues from templates (remote work application).
** TODO Move config to YAML and handle user install via ~/.config/fatjira
** TODO Package so it's pip-installable
** TODO Make the search non-blocking (threading should be just fine)
** TODO Make the synchronization non-blocking.
** TODO Generic table renderer - not bound to the view.
** TODO Transitioning issue.
   Learning which transitions are possible might be tricky, but it should be
   simple to handle few simple transitions for most projects.
** TODO Assigning issue.
   - To myself, unassigning
* [0/4] v3: Further Ideas
** TODO Queuening all operations on jira in a queue in case there's a lag.
   Ability to revisit the queue, see operations and retry failed.
   This would need the ops to be defined differentially.
** TODO Editing yaml-exported issue in an external editor - jira-go like.
** TODO Board view.
** TODO Backlog view.


* Bugs?
** TODO Should each searched term match only the beginning of words?
** TODO Use \ or "" to combine terms?
