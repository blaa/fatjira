* What
  Yacui is a Magit inspired Console User Interface library. If you haven't used
  Magit, the tl;dr is:
  1. Screen is split into two: the current "view" and available key bindings.
  2. You navigate the interface using a single (or combined) letters.

  Magit interface allows for easy discoverability and low learning curve. Simple
  mnemonic controls let you build muscle memory and use it fast when you've
  learned it. We need more software like that.

  "Screenshot" of an imagined cookbook app:
  #+begin_src
  Cookbook application

  1. Recipe for cookies
  2. Recipe for cake *SELECTED*


  --------------------------------------
   q Quit            n Next
   N Add new recipe  p Previous
   D Delete recipe   Enter View recipe
  Status: New recipe added successfully!
  #+end_src

  I need this in my small internal project, but doing this lib with a nice API
  was my guilty pleasure. I'd love to have a full Jira interface in console
  (Majira?) but my attention span is too short to code it.

  Name is bad, but most names are taken.

* Usage
  Install pipenv and then use it to download dependencies.
  TODO: Package as a library
  #+begin_src bash
   $ sudo apt install pipenv
   $ pipenv install
   $ pipenv shell
   # Run an example:
   $ ./example.py
   #+end_src
   I include this as a subtree in my other projects until it matures.
* Docs / doodles.
#+begin_src
App ----> Console
    \---> Display  ---> Current View
     \--> Bindings  \-> View history
      \-> Discovery
#+end_src

** App
   Ties everything together. Can hold additional "global" state required by the
   app, although most of state should be handled by views.

*** Event loop
    Reads keys, and uses Bindings to resolve an action. If nothing is happening
    it's calling a tick on the current view once a second.

    This maaaybe nicer using asyncio, but currently works just fine and is
    simple.

** Console
   Manages ncurses; initializes/deinitializes screen.
   Splits screen in windows, offers a low-level input control.

** Display (current display)
   Holds the current View instance. Manages backward/forward navigation between
   view instances.

   Manages views lifecycle by calling their on_enter/on_leave/on_drop methods.

** View / View
  A View controls what is displayed. Can always redraw the view data on the
  screen in case of resize event or view navigation.

  It also controls what actions can be executed and what other views can be
  visited.

** Bindings
   Converts pressed buttons into executed actions. There's only one instance of
   Bindings class.

   Current bindings can be pushed/popped from the binding stack.

** Discovery
   Renders the current bindings in a usable and automatic way while preserving
   their order.

** Handling of state
   View can have multiple instances displaying in the same way different data.
   If necessary can share state via class members or app object. Therefore View
   instances hold the main app state.

   Display manages screens and doesn't hold additional state information. Global
   state (db connections, etc.) can be stored in the App instance.
* Project management.
  This renders bad on Github. Use org-mode/emacs or ignore this part.

** TODO Basics 2/2
*** DONE Display bindings with common offset
    CLOSED: [2020-09-26 Sat 17:08]
*** DONE Handle bindings with C-, M- prefix and <enter>
    CLOSED: [2020-09-26 Sat 17:08]
*** DONE Pass unhandled keybindings to the view.
    CLOSED: [2020-09-26 Sat 17:08]
*** DONE Allow view to instantiate the subview before navigating
    CLOSED: [2020-09-27 Sun 22:53]
    So it can use subview as a modal, for example action requires selected item,
    so it opens a subview for selection, but instructs it first what is it
    looking for and sets callbacks.
*** DONE Logging / debugging
    CLOSED: [2020-09-30 Wed 22:29]
    Debug window, opened with --debug; helps a bit with development.
*** TODO Maybe suggested way of handling futures

    It's easy when you don't miss something obvious - like recreating windows.

      Partially. Via getkey not really, via SIGWINCH mostly YES, but the number of
      cols is not refreshed everywhere.
*** TODO Handle escape codes without delays
    Current half-delay approach will break when someone types M-o twice
    or ESC twice fast.
*** TODO A reusable almost advanced internal editor.
    Either embed readline... or implement it. Can't be too hard.
    Minimum keys support:
    movement: C-f, C-b, M-f, M-b, C-a, C-e, C-n, C-p, LEFT, RIGHT
    edit: M-BACKSPACE, M-d, C-k, BACKSPACE, typing in insert mode
    C-y (yank previous cut)
    Maybe: mark (C-Space)

    console.textpad after rereading the docs can work without blocking so it might be ok.
    Although I'm unsure if it's worth using. The keys would have to be wrapped anyway.
*** TODO Executing an external editor for advanced edits.
*** DONE Non-blocking input method for incremental search.
    Implemented by passing an unhandled keypresses to the view and then in 6
    lines of code - without full edit though.

** TODO Package this as a library
** TODO Add unit tests for core mechanisms.
   - Mock console
   - Test View navigation, droping, bindings push/pop
   - Create mechanism for sending key presses and checking result,
     to have an api to test applications, not the lib itself.
